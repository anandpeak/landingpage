    "comments": "Compared to the previous paper-based onboarding program, the process has become faster. It gives a more modern and innovative feeling. Saving paper has a positive impact from an ESG perspective and also saves the HR team's time. The ability to track progress provides an advantage for making further improvements. The gamified format, I believe, gives our employees a fresh, engaging, and professional experience. Thank you to the Metacog team for developing such a great solution that keeps up with the times."
